# Hi, I'm Abinand 👋  

My GitHub is a collection of random programming projects and curiosities including but not limited to game programming, webgl and canvas graphics, data visualization, statistical analysis and anything else that fancies my interests. 

Most of my repositories are private since this space is mostly meant to be a backup and learning log. 

The public repos typically contain portfolio projects that I mention on my [website](https://www.abinand.com).
