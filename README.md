# Hi, I'm Abinand ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a former software developer with a background in web applications and a bit of game programming, now transitioning into **data analytics**.  I later moved into a **business analyst role**, where I worked closely with data to support decision-making. This experience sharpened my skills in **requirements gathering, documentation, and analysis**, and gave me perspective on how data is used to drive business outcomes.

My GitHub started as a collection of programming projects from my software engineering days, but going forward it will showcase my journey in analyticsâ€”covering **data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis**.  

ðŸ’¡ **What I bring:**  
- Strong foundation in **problem-solving, algorithms, and programming** from my development background  
- A growing focus on **data-driven decision making**, tied to my background and interests in E-commerce, Payments, Supply Chain, Games and Education.  
- Passion for **working with data, math, code, and text** to uncover insights  

ðŸ“‚ **What you'll find here:**  
- Past projects in **game programming and software development**  
- Ongoing and future projects in **data analysis and visualization** using Python, SQL, and modern analytics tools  

Iâ€™m building this portfolio to demonstrate my skills to future employers and collaborators as I move deeper into the world of **data analytics**.  

I see this space as both a **portfolio** and a **learning log** â€” a place where I can demonstrate my skills, track my growth, and share my work with others.
