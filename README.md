# Hi, I'm Abinand ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a former software developer with a background in web applications and a bit of game programming, now transitioning into **data analytics**.  

My GitHub started as a collection of programming projects from my software engineering days, but going forward it will showcase my journey in analyticsâ€”covering **data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis**.  

**What I bring:**  
- Strong foundation in **problem-solving, algorithms, and programming** from my development background  
- A growing focus on **data-driven decision making**, tied to my background and interests in E-commerce, Payments, Supply Chain, Games and Education.  
- Passion for **working with data, math, code, and text** to uncover insights  

**What you'll find here:**  
- Past projects in **game programming and software development**  
- Ongoing and future projects in **data analysis and visualization** using Python, SQL, and modern analytics tools  

I see this space as both a **portfolio** and a **learning log** â€” a place where I can demonstrate my skills, track my growth, and share my work with others.
